# Getting Started with Next.js 14: A Complete Guide

Next.js 14 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building React applications even more powerful and efficient. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore everything you need to know to get started with Next.js 14.

## What's New in Next.js 14

### App Router (Stable)
The App Router is now stable and provides a more intuitive way to structure your applications. It offers:

- **Server Components by default** - Better performance and SEO
- **Nested layouts** - Share UI between routes
- **Loading states** - Built-in loading UI
- **Error handling** - Error boundaries and error pages

### Turbopack (Beta)
Turbopack is the new bundler that's up to 10x faster than Webpack:

```bash
npm run dev --turbo
```

### Server Actions
Server Actions allow you to run server-side code directly from your components:

```typescript
async function createUser(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';
  
  const name = formData.get('name');
  const email = formData.get('email');
  
  // Save to database
  await saveUser({ name, email });
}
```

## Setting Up Your First Next.js 14 Project

1. **Create a new project:**
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

2. **Choose your configuration:**
   - TypeScript: Yes
   - ESLint: Yes
   - Tailwind CSS: Yes
   - App Router: Yes
   - Customize default import alias: No

## Project Structure

With the App Router, your project structure looks like this:

```
app/
├── globals.css
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── loading.tsx
├── error.tsx
└── blog/
    ├── page.tsx
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx
```

## Key Concepts

### Server vs Client Components

By default, all components are Server Components. To make a component interactive, add the 'use client' directive:

```typescript
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Data Fetching

Server Components can fetch data directly:

```typescript
async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function BlogPage() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
          <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when you need interactivity
2. **Leverage the App Router** - Take advantage of nested layouts and loading states
3. **Optimize images** - Use the Next.js Image component for better performance
4. **Implement proper SEO** - Use metadata API for better search engine optimization

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 represents a significant step forward in React development. With its stable App Router, improved performance, and developer experience enhancements, it's an excellent choice for your next project.
